\subsection{Simulation Methodologies}

Simulation methodologies are essential for understanding and modeling complex systems. They provide a framework for analyzing real-world processes through various modeling techniques. Key aspects include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose of Simulation:} To create high-level representations of real-world systems, allowing for analysis and optimization.
    \item \textbf{Importance of Modeling Techniques:} Different techniques cater to various types of systems and scenarios, enhancing the applicability of simulations.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Modeling Techniques}

Modeling techniques are foundational to simulation methodologies. They can be categorized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discrete vs. Continuous Models:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Discrete Models:} Change at specific intervals, such as customer arrivals at a store. These models capture events that occur at distinct points in time.
        \item \textit{Continuous Models:} Represent systems that change continuously, like weather patterns, where variables fluctuate constantly.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Stochastic vs. Deterministic Models:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Stochastic Models:} Incorporate randomness and variability, making them suitable for unpredictable systems.
        \item \textit{Deterministic Models:} Provide fixed outcomes based on initial conditions, often leading to less engaging analyses.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% Challenges and Limitations
\textit{Challenges:} Discrete models may oversimplify continuous processes, while stochastic models can introduce complexity that complicates analysis.

\subsubsection{Simulation Applications}

Simulation methodologies find applications across various fields, demonstrating their versatility and effectiveness:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Health Systems:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Patient Flow Modeling:} Helps in optimizing scheduling and resource allocation.
        \item \textit{Disease Surveillance:} Assists in tracking and managing outbreaks through predictive modeling.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Manufacturing:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Part Flow Evaluation:} Analyzes the movement of parts through production lines to identify inefficiencies.
        \item \textit{Resource Demand Assessment:} Ensures that resources are allocated effectively to meet production goals.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% Challenges and Limitations
\textit{Challenges:} Health system simulations may struggle with data accuracy, while manufacturing simulations can be limited by the complexity of real-world interactions.
